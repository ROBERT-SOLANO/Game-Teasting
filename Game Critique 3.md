   7 Days to die was released on December 13, 2013, and was developed by The Fun Pimps. The game is focused on the idea of survival horror as you are an individual in a world alone fending for your life against the zombies focusing on food, water, and a well-defended base so you can defend yourself against the horde of zombies that appears every 7 days. But since 2013 several updates have come along that have changed how we the player see seven days to die as we are currently able to play the experimental build of Alpha 17. This Alpha has changed so much from what we are used to no more continuous crafting to level up your equipment to the best possible rarity, no more needing to do the same thing over and over again to level it up, and no more needing to gain exp alone, All this has been changed this build allowing us to see seven days in a new light.
  
  The pros to all this we have gotten new mechanics in the game that allow us to have a new and enjoyable experience with 7 days. These being multiplayer now has an aspect for everyone as our base builders can now get exp from anywhere in the world due to the new party system mechanic allowing looters/explorers to be able to get that exp for our base builders back home which always use to be a problem back in alpha 16. Secondly we got a new leveling system as stated earlier the only way we used to be able to level up was by making or doing the same thing over and over again well now that has changed as everything is now locked behind simple levels and skill points allowing u to be able to focus on one skill tree or multiple skill trees. Third, we got a new item rarity system where now weapons range from 1-6 one being the worst and 6 being the best as well as no more item degration when repairing your weapons. And lastly for me personally I love the fact that they added new vehicles to use in this new alpha allowing for even more exploration.
  
  The cons to all the new good stuff we got is a couple of things that haven't been implemented, broken, or just don't work. These being new weapon mods, a new death penalty, and old crafting stations that are used to progress the game. These two things allow for a better gameplay experience but due to this being an experimental build it is expected that some things will be broken and we can only hope that they will be fixed soon.
  
   So all in all if I needed to be the one to test out 7 Days in its current alpha the main focus points I would currently wanna test would be these. First off the new skills as they are beneficial to the player and a are needed to ensure your survival in the game. Secondly, the new vehicles are a must due to the much-needed exploration as you need to loot to find food and valuable resources. Third, I would have to say the new gun and vehicle mods but due to the weapon/vehicle mod schematics not currently being able to be craftable the only way to truly test them is to find them by looting around the world map. Forth I would honestly have to just say the party mechanic and shared exp as this is truly a mechanic that needs to be focused on to ensure you and your friends can get the most exp as fast as possible and as quickly as possible to ensure your maximum survival. These would be the main focus points I believe players should test in the new alpha build of 7 days as they seem to be the newest add-ons to the game and the main features everyone wants to learn about.
