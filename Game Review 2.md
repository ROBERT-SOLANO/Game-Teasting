Game Title: Portal Knights

# Pros-

1. Decent Gameplay with Easy Controls and nice atmosphere.
2. Multiplayer is stable friends aren't teleporting around or falling off the map due to lag spikes or ping issues.
3. Freedom to create your own story and progress at your own rate
4. Combat is simple and basic allowing for easy learnability.

# Cons-

1.	There is no sprint button only a dodge which does act as a sprint but would be a nice addition for basic movement speed. As dodging everywhere you go allows for repetitive gameplay and a can get a bit annoying.
2.	World generation tends to be a bit mean at points due to the constant bottomless pits. With these on almost every turn due to the world being sky islands, this can cause some unnecessary deaths and does get annoying due to there not being any way to fix it besides making bridges with blocks.
3.	Weapons can be upgraded but your starting wand and wands you get later on tend to have the same animations and do the same, thing. So in a sense, there is no sense of true accomplishment when getting a new weapon besides looks and the extra amount of damage you see when you attack.

# Summary
Portal Knights are very similar to Minecraft gameplay for starters. The basis of the game consists of you and your friends choosing classes and exploring a world you need to save. In doing so, this takes Minecraft gameplay and mixes it with a bit or Terraria’s boss and item system to make a whole new game that combines basic knowledge Minecrafters know and apply it to this. Allowing for a whole new type of gameplay because now not only do you have to worry about RPG aspects you also have to figure out what will make you stronger. I played this with one of my friends which allowed me to get two different views of the game and gameplay. I went down the Mage path of the game while He went down the Warrior path allowing for two different type of gameplay to be reviewed today. With this, I focused on upgrades and building the base, while he explored the mini-dungeons around the map and completed the quest that we needed to do upon reaching new worlds to get exp and continue on with the story. With this we were able to see a decent amount of the begging of the game allowing us to see and hone on our combat methods and gameplay of both our classes. 
With being a Mage in the game, it allowed for ranged combat with elemental attacks. With this in mind Mages tend to be great for bosses as we noticed with the First boss we encountered. As I was building my mage currently to be squishy but dish out decent damage, I was able to dish out a lot but could barely take attacks myself.  The weapons tend to be interesting as I was able to obtain three a wand, a magic sword, and an exploding ball of magic. These all acted differently but were all received by the first boss we encountered allowing for decent damage but also some really bad damage as well. I liked the wand and magic ball allot while the sword is lackluster and didn’t seem like a useful item at all. Downsides of my class are you would expect a mage to have a constant mana regen that would allow for constant spell casting well in this game it wasn’t the case and tended to get very annoying because my heal takes almost half of my mana bar. 
Now on to the warrior as described by my friend seemed to be very basic and the typical norm of any RPG. You are stuck to using three weapon types sword, hammer, and battleaxe and as per usual the warrior is also usually the tank. With these in mind, he described it as lackluster and repetitive just tanking the damage for me and applying as much DPS as humanly possible while being able to manage his health to a point. Mana was easy as the only ability needed was enraged which allowed for easy mana management for him.  For weapons due to him sticking to the sword, this allowed for basic, attacks as it seemed like swords, hammers, and battle axes showed any signs of special moves or game changers.  

# Final Thoughts
Was it fun personally between us both yes we can agree that we could personally put more hours than the two we put in today as well as possibly even being able to beat the game. It is very nice to relax and enjoy the atmosphere with a friend allowing for an easy timewaster as grinding levels and items will take some time. So overall personally a fun experience and a very fun timewaster allowing for easy learnability.
