# After watching some the testing activities required to test Halo, name two skills that are important for a tester to have?
	
  From my point of view two skills, I believe a tester should have patience and the ability to learn daily. Reason for this is they need to be able to sit there continuously for hours on end doing the same thing to see if they get results back that are either expected to happen or not. Secondly the ability to learn new testing methods daily to make their life easier when it comes to testing the same aspect over and over again to ensure the quality stays the same for the game and anyother they test in the future. 


# What do you think is hardest about being a tester based watching the video?
	
  The frustration of testing the levels/game, in general, seems like the hardest aspect from the testers point of view. As some levels need to be tweaked/ balanced for difficulty allowing for something that should take ten mins could take a tester two hours of frustration. Second is most likely needing to have the patient to actively test the same thing repeatedly for hours on end every day to ensure quality and performance expected from the game you are testing. 

# What is something new you learned about being a tester? Or something you found interesting?
	
What I found interesting as a tester based on the videos was just the time and effort put into the constant test of basic things implemented in the game. One this that surprised me that was stated was the fact of the daily need to check if there was a new hole in the map where a player could get out of the map to needing to jump in the same place hundreds of times to see if the user could crash the game. Then what I learned is the frustrating aspect of the whole playtest in general being that at point a user will come to a point where they will get aggravated and wanna stop playing the game, and as a developer you need to figure out how to tweak and get it fixed to ensure the players happiness as well as to be able to keep the game playable.
