# Summary
    In Dead By Daylight there are four types of gameplay styles Light bringer (objectives), Unbroken(survival), Benevolent (Altruism), and Evader (Boldness).  To get down to playing stealthy in this game comes down to the character with the darkest clothes as well as choosing the best abilities for the occasion. The only character to play this style of gameplay is Claudette Morel. She is the best character for people who like to just be Benevolent and try and stay away from getting found. For her build to be pure Benevolent is to choose her darkest clothes in the beginning and then go about choosing four immersed abilities examples being Urban Evasion, Balanced Landing, self-care, We will make It.   Now on to this gameplay, the perfect way to play this build is to one hide when the killer is near best way to avoid it is hide or hide in a locker. Now when not in these situations the gameplay here is to stay crouched and wander around the map trying to find generators to complete the object to allow your other three teammates. Upon working on a generator, you wanna keep aware of your surroundings and audio cues to allow when you need to hide, or crouch walk away. Just remember when playing like this a locker or a dark corner is your best friend to get away from the killer, but if you get in a chase with the killer, Balanced landing will be your savior.  Allowing you to fall from a height for a quick speed boost when you fall from said object allowing you to get away from the killer if you use the speed boost and urban evasion to your advantage. Now if your teammates have been hooked, you wanna hide near or close by to where they have been hooked and allow for the killer to walk away. By doing this, you can then use we will make it to save them off the hook and be able to heal them to full health to allow all of you to get out of the map. This is the best way to play stealth like in Dbd and is used by many individuals currently.

# Final Thoughts
  Was it fun personally for me honestly no as I do not like playing this gameplay style nor do I like playing the game. Reasons for this is mainly because without friends the game does get harder for the individual as most people at lower ranks tend to not go for hooks saves. So in my honest opinion, this game does offer tons of hours to individuals who honestly enjoy the gameplay, but as for me, I will stick to playing kill your friends to get my best experience out of the game.
