# Summary
 Megaman X in my opinion is one of the best out of the x Franchise and was one of the first X games I owned. With this i was able to pick it up and play it for hours on end and this all started with the Psp version which introduced the X series to me which then encouraged me to go out and pick up an snes copy for my self. So out of both here is what you can get from each. Lets start off with the  psp version right off the back better graphics, smoother soundtract, and better controls as well as an additonal story. As for the snes its the same base X story that you play through on both the psp and snes. So outa the two you get the same gameplay experience with the PSP version adding a little spice to the mix allowing you to play as Ville which adds new gameplay mechanics and a new story throught the eyes for the villan. But as far as all this goes you get 8 Robot Master Abilities, 8 Heart Canisters, 4 E Tanks, 4 armor pieces, and lastly a Hadoken Upgrade. With all this the game allows for countless hours of replayability with constant entertainment. 

# Final Thoughts
 So all in Megaman X is a wholesome Megaman title. Hours of gameplay and hours of fun and all the routes allow for endless possibilities.
