  Sonic Heroes was released by sega in 2003 allowing our blue hedgehog to get a new sense of gameplay after his debute in the adventure series. The game consist of four teams that consist of Team Hero, Team Dark, Team Rose, and Team Chaotix then there are three types of character types these being Speed, Power, and Flight. The game was released on gamecube, playstation 2, xbox as well as pc the more polished versions being the gamecube and pc ports while the playstation 2 and xbox being buggy and glithcy. With this in mind the game in general along all consoles this being floaty controls and just colision aspects thatcould have easilly been fixed during production. 
  Now when it comes to gameplaythe dificulty goes trough with this Team Rose is easy mode with shorter stages and less enemies, Team Hero is normal mode with full length stages with regular enemy spawns, and then Team Dark which is hard mode with more harder enemies. Now personally to be able to put Team Chaotix on this chart would have to be to preffence as there gameplay are objective based so based on personal experience i generally put them along side team dark as I personally hate there gameplay as the stages take to long and sometimes one item can take you like 30 mins to find. 
  As far as controlls they function well but could have easilly been worked on. This can be shown by playing as a Speed character if you start going at top speed and were to barely move ur analog stick u can easly just move outa controll to the somewhere else allowing for iffy gamplay as this can somtimes lead you to death or just slow you down in speed sections. This can also play a part in the Power characters of both Hero and Dark as they tend to be a bit slidy and floaty when you perform basic attacks allowing for you to be on edge at all times when using them as you need to make sure you are not going to slide off the map and fall to your death as this seems to always be a problem to worry about due to sliding. 
  Then we have our special stages which tend towork perfectly fine on pc, and Playstation, and Xbox but can be a bit buggy on Gamecube. Gamecubes main bugg with the special stages is once again random colision and slow down when trying to go at high speeds during the race to the chaos emerald allowing for a bad experience when trying to get all 7. But the onyl purpose to really get all 7 emeralds is to unlock the final boss of the game.
  All in all I Really Enjoy Sonic Heros for what it is the music is amazing, graphics and enviornments are beautiful to look at and as far as story it is good for what it is.
