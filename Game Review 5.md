# Summary 
 Allthough it has been a while since ive picked up both my copies of doom for pc and snes it stilla lways brings back the memories i had as a kid. The music sets the tone allowing my self to become imeresed in the game allowing my self to feel that adrenalin rush and horror atmosphere. It was a sense of excitment i didnt really get to experience untill i was older and didnt get scared with the music from the 3rd level. This was an amazing experience to playthorugh again brining back all the memories and fun times i had with my brother back in the day seeing who could get further in the game before we both got to scared and needed to turn it off to even playing the multiplayer deathmatch in the xbox360 emulation of doom. All in all doom is a great series with excelent gameplay, controlls,a dn replay ability and this is all thanks to how they built the game. Every level has secrets and items to find allowing you at the end of each level to see and view your progress with each replay. If its your first time playing you may only get 50 percent of the items and secrets in the first map but after palying and exploring your next playthorugh u may be able to start 100% it everytime. With this its just trully a wonderfull throw back to my childhood and that will never change.
 
# Final Thoughts 
  My Final thoughts are trully this Doom is a wonderfull game that everyone needs to experiece. The controlls on pc seem faster than the ones on the snes while each are there own both play the same and allow for a wonderfull time. Controlls i would rate a 10 due to when it was made and its time. For Playability i would rate an 8 due to depending on the individual they may only be able to play a while before getting bored or not being able to cut it. And lastly Experience i would rate 10 as thanks to the moding community on pc doom allows for many different experiences with every new mod that a modder will release and to this day the community stays strong and the game still feels as new as it does the first time you play it.
